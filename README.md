## A challenge to create a calendar and task list that tracks the time and allows you to save tasks to local storage.

I created a webpage from a given template that tracks the time by hour with DayJS and then allows you to click the save button after you've saved text inside the text area. When you refresh the page it will keep the saved content.

## Usage
Time is tracked automatically using DayJS. Input text in the text area and hit the corresonding save button. This stores the value in two separate arrays that track the text and the location. When the page is refreshed those values are sent back to the appropriate text boxes. Have fun!
